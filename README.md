Welcome! 👋 This repository contains the official implementation of our **ICASSP 2025** paper:  
**"PDSeg: Patch-Wise Distillation and Controllable Image Generation for Weakly-Supervised Histopathology Tissue Segmentation"**.

We propose a novel framework that combines patch-wise knowledge distillation with controllable image generation to push the boundaries of weakly-supervised tissue segmentation in histopathology images.
